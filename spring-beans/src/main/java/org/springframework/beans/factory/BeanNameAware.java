/**
 * 实现了 BeanNameAware 接口的 bean 可以获取其在 Spring 容器中的名字。
 * 当 Spring 容器创建该 bean 的实例后，会调用 setBeanName 方法，将该实例在容器中的名字传递给它。
 * 通过实现该接口，你可以在 bean 内部获取自身在容器中的名字，以便做进一步的操作或管理。
 * Interface to be implemented by beans that want to be aware of their
 * bean name in a bean factory. Note that it is not usually recommended
 * that an object depends on its bean name, as this represents a potentially
 * brittle dependence on external configuration, as well as a possibly
 * unnecessary dependence on a Spring API.
 *
 * <p>For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the
 * {@link BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.
